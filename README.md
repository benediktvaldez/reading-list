# Reading list

Just a list of books I'm reading, have recently read or am planning on reading

I try to link to goodreads.com for each book, and if it is a part of a series I mention that in brackets behind the book name *(Name of Series #BookNumber)*. I'll try to take the time soon to mark the ones I found noteworthy with some kind of emoji.
