# Reading list

Just a list of books I'm reading, have recently read or am planning on reading

I try to link to goodreads.com for each book, and if it is a part of a series I mention that in brackets behind the book name _(Name of Series #BookNumber)_. I'll try to take the time soon to mark the ones I found noteworthy with some kind of emoji.

#### [Thirteen Reasons Why](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29844228-thirteen-reasons-why) by Jay Asher

#### Constitution _(Legacy Fleet #1)_ by Nick Webb

> Meh… If you like war, and space, and the idea of mixing the two, it's probably an interesting series.

#### Fuzzy Nation by John Scalzi

#### [Rip-Off!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17156415-rip-off)\* by Several authors

> 13 writers of speculative fiction pick a favorite opening line from a classic piece of literature, then use it as the first sentence of an entirely original short story. Some definitely better than others, but worth a listen.
